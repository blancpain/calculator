Written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, this is part of The Odin Project curriculum.

# Key Takeaways

This one was definitely challenging especially in terms of implementing the logic related to storing user inputs, temporary totals, chaining operators etc. The project has been super rewarding in terms of revisiting concepts related to function creation and usage (especially in helping to reduce lenghty code - although there is still room for improvement in this regard and I plan on refactoring further). I also learned more about event listeners and implementing mouse + keyboard support. 

Overall I am quite happy with the final result in terms of usability. There were numerous hurdles and bugs along the way but what really helped me was writing out what the expected behaviour is in a pseudo code format and then figuring out how to actually translate this into code. This is something I plan on doing going forward especially as projects get more and more complex.
